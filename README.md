# Idea
A repository that stores my intersting and innovative idea manifested in code, including C++, Python or other programming language.


These ideas may seem naive to you, because I am just on the start of the road. 
But if you have suggestions or ideas, you can message to me or just modify my code.
I wish we can get better by helping each other.
